Before starting, make sure to put all the dataset images into yelp-data/photos outside of the project folder,
and create an output directory inside the project folder.

----------------

`data` - directory of image JSON (one JSON file for each image subset)

`preprocess.py` - for preprocessing

`custom_model.py` - custom CNN

`resnet.py` - ResNet

`gan.py` - GAN

`test.py` - for testing single image; needs saved model architecture (JSON) and weights (h5)

----------------

Run the model you want with `python3 <model>.py`.
